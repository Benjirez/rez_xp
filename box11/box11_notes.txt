nodejs app 

browserify used to convert view1.js into bundle.js which allows the use of nodejs modules in the browser via var module_name = require('module_name');

app.js is the entry point

conroller1 sets up routes

view1.ejs loads bundle.js via <script src="views/bundle.js"></script>

use: when browser window has focus, pressing 1, 2, 3 (without much delay) triggers a hotkey (via mousetrap) which them copies to the clipboard (via clipboard-copy) a message from chewbacca... paste to see!
